# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Parler-TTS is a lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) model that generates high-quality, natural speech with controllable voice characteristics through text descriptions. It's a reproduction of work from Stability AI and Edinburgh University.

## Architecture

The system has three main components:
1. **Text encoder**: Frozen Flan-T5 model that maps text descriptions to hidden representations
2. **Parler-TTS decoder**: Language model that generates audio tokens conditioned on encoder representations
3. **Audio codec**: DAC model from Descript that converts audio tokens back to waveforms

Key implementation details:
- Text **description** goes through encoder for cross-attention in decoder
- Text **prompt** goes through embedding layer and concatenates to decoder inputs
- Uses DAC codec instead of EnCodec for better audio quality

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1")

# Generate audio with description and prompt

## Project Objectives
‚Ä¢	The current Parler-TTS model feeds a text description through an encoder for cross-attention in the decoder.
‚Ä¢	We will build a model that uses a set of pre-computed vectors (the outputs of that encoder) instead of processing the description text at runtime.
‚Ä¢	The pre-computed vectors are 1024-dimensional embeddings obtained by running text tokens through the encoder. Some of these embeddings correspond closely to style attributes‚Äîe.g., gender (male, female), pitch (low, medium, high), accent (American, British, ‚Ä¶), speed (slow, moderate, quick), modulation (monotone, animated), quality (clean, noisy)‚Äîwhile others are non-attribute vectors.
‚Ä¢	Removing the encoder at inference makes the model more efficient.
‚Ä¢	Simply cross-attending these vectors in the decoder yields poor audio quality, so we will apply PEFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning) to each vector.
‚Ä¢	Specifically, we will use LoRA adapters on all vectors, and for the attribute-related vectors we will also employ a VAE to extract mean and variance.
‚Ä¢	We will freeze all parameters of the pre-trained parler-tts-mini-v1 model except for those introduced by our PEFT modules.
‚Ä¢	We will train using a combined loss: the decoder‚Äôs codebook reconstruction loss, the VAE‚Äôs KL loss, and an orthogonality regularizer to ensure the PEFT-enhanced vectors remain distinct.
* There are six attributes in total, and the possible values for each attribute are as follows:
attribute_values = {
    "gender": ["male", "female"],
    "pitch": ["high", "low", "medium"],
    "speed": ["slowly", "quickly", "moderate"],
    "accent": [
      "Slovenia", "Chinese", "German", "Irish", "Scottish", "Russian", "Polish",
      "Canadian", "Turkish", "Czech", "Jamaica", "Italian", "Swiss", "Brazilian", "Brooklyn",
      "Finnish", "Japanese", "Filipino", "British",
      "Indian", "Australian", "Norwegian", "English",
      "Romania", "Spanish", "Croatia", "Swedish", "Colombia", "French", "American",
      "Mexican", "Portuguese", "Dominic", "Welsh", "Nigeria",
      "Chile", "Belgia", "Dutch", "Jordan", "Serbia", "Ukrainian", "Mandarin"
    ],
    "modulation": ["monoton", "animated"],
    "quality": ["clean", "noisy"]
}
## Implementation Plan
1.	Modify the existing model so that it generates speech from the pre-computed vectors rather than from the description text.
2.	Add PEFT modules to each of the pre-computed vectors.
3.	During training, the input ‚Äúpre-computed vectors‚Äù are provided as follows. For example, given the sentence
‚ÄúA female voice with American accent speaks quickly at a medium pitch and a noisy quality,‚Äù
you receive a sequence of pre-computed vectors‚Äîone for each token. The vectors corresponding to attribute tokens (female, American, quickly, medium, noisy) are trained via their respective VAE modules, while all other vectors (A, voice, with, ‚Ä¶, and, quality) are trained using LoRA. Each attribute can take on multiple values‚Äîfor instance, the gender attribute can be ‚Äúmale‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale‚Äù‚Äîand each value uses its own separate VAE weights. In other words, every possible attribute value is learned by its own dedicated VAE.
4.	From the input pre‚Äêcomputed vectors, determine which indices correspond to attribute tokens and which correspond to ‚Äúother‚Äù tokens. Then apply the matching PEFT module (VAE for attributes, LoRA for non‚Äêattributes) to each vector during training.
5.	Update the training code so that, given the pre-computed vectors, a text prompt, and paired speech data, only the PEFT parameters are fine-tuned.
6.	Write an inference script that, given a set of pre-computed vectors and input text, produces synthesized speech.
